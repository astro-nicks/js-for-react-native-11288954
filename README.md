# Array and User Info Manipulation

## Overview

This project consists of three main tasks implemented in JavaScript. The tasks include processing arrays of numbers, formatting strings based on these numbers, and creating user profiles from given names.

### Task 1: Process Array of Numbers

The `processArray` function takes an array of numbers as an argument and returns a new array where each even number is squared and each odd number is tripled.

### Task 2: Format Array Strings

The `formatArrayStrings` function takes two arrays as arguments: an array of strings and an array of numbers processed by `processArray`. It returns a new array of strings where each string is capitalized if its corresponding number is even and converted to lowercase if its corresponding number is odd.

### Task 3: Create User Profiles

The `createUserProfiles` function takes an array of names and the array of modified names from Task 2. It returns an array of objects, each containing `originalName`, `modifiedName`, and `id` (auto-incremented starting from 1).
